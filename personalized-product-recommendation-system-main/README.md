# Personalized Product Recommendation System

An end-to-end hybrid recommender system built using transactional and demographic data from Horizon Hobby. This project combines collaborative filtering, content-based modeling, and business logic to generate real-time, personalized product suggestions.

>  **Built in Python | Modeled in Jupyter | Fully deployable**

---

##  Objective

To improve customer retention and conversion rates by delivering context-aware product recommendations. This system leverages customer demographics, transaction history, and product metadata to drive personalized discovery, uplift loyalty, and maximize ROI.

---

##  Solution Architecture

- **Data Modeling**: Star schema with fact + dimension tables (transactions, products, customers, dates, promotions)
- **Feature Engineering**: Loyalty tiering, RFM, purchase recency, promotion exposure, seasonality
- **Modeling Stack**:
  - Global & Segmented Popularity (baselines)
  - Matrix Factorization using ALS (implicit feedback)
  - Content-based similarity (TF-IDF + user profiles)
  - Hybrid Recommender (weighted ensemble of above)
- **Evaluation**: Precision@5, Recall@5, NDCG@5 across user segments
- **Deployment Ready**: FastAPI pipeline (proposed), batch inference + schema for frontend integration

##  Key Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|  Data Preprocessing | Merged customer, product, promo, and transaction tables |
|  User Segmentation | Loyalty tiering, gender/age breakout |
|  Collaborative Filtering | ALS-based user-product matrix with cold-start fallback |
|  Content-Based Modeling | Cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors |
|  Hybrid Strategy | Weighted blend of collaborative + content-based scores |
|  Evaluation Dashboard | NDCG, Precision@5, Recall@5 by loyalty, age group, promo exposure |

##  Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:
-  End-to-end ML system design from data wrangling to API planning
-  Strong hybrid modeling expertise (ALS + TF-IDF)
-  MLOps awareness through pipeline planning and segment-wise evaluation
-  Business alignment with promotions, loyalty tiers, and margin-aware filtering

> Note: This is a production-style recommender system built from scratch with a strong balance of business impact and machine learning rigor.
